# Earth-Quake-Prediction

## **Description:**

* **An earthquake is a natural geological phenomenon that occurs when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in seismic waves that propagate through the Earth.**

* **Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. The Earth's crust is divided into large, rigid plates that are constantly moving, albeit very slowly. When these plates interact with each other, they can either move apart, slide past each other, or collide. The boundaries where tectonic plates meet are known as fault lines.**

**There are several types of earthquakes:**

**1. **Tectonic Earthquakes:** These are the most common type of earthquakes and occur along fault lines when tectonic plates either collide, move apart, or slide past each other.**

**2. **Volcanic Earthquakes:** These earthquakes are associated with volcanic activity. They occur when magma movement or the collapse of volcanic material generates seismic waves.**

**3. **Induced Earthquakes:** Human activities, such as mining, reservoir-induced seismicity (caused by the filling of large dams), or hydraulic fracturing (fracking), can induce earthquakes.**

**When an earthquake occurs, it releases energy in the form of seismic waves, which travel through the Earth in all directions from the point of the initial rupture. The point on the Earth's surface directly above the earthquake's origin is called the epicenter, while the point within the Earth where the earthquake originates is called the hypocenter or focus.**

**Earthquakes can cause various hazards, including ground shaking, surface rupture, landslides, tsunamis (if the earthquake occurs underwater), and secondary effects like fires and structural collapse. Proper earthquake preparedness and building resilient structures are essential for minimizing the potential impact of earthquakes on human lives and infrastructure.**


## Datasets Infromation:

### Introduction About the Data :

**The dataset** The goal is to predict `Magnitude`,`Longitude`,`Latitude` of the Earth Quakke (Decision Tree Regressor).

There are 3 independent variables :

* `Day`
* `Month`
* `Year`

Target variable:
* `Magnitude`: Magnitude of earth quake or power of the earth quake.
* `Longitude`: (Direction) refer the location of the eath quake using satellite coordinates.
* `Latitude` : refer to the other coordinate of the location on earth.
